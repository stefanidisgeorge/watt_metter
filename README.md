Our modern way of life made us consuming enormous amount of electrical energy. This phenomenon drove to the climate change and warming the planet. Everybody says that people must become more energy aware.

Just informing people led to a dead-end and nobody cared. So, as engineers we thought that people may be motivated to consume less energy if they are informed about the energy consumption of their electrical devices. We designed and implemented a simple watt meter based on Arduino Board using an current clamp sensor and ethernet shield. Also we designed a website for hosting and presenting the current and average values of power consumption.

We believe if everybody sees  how much energy he or she is consuming may start to be more energy efficient.
